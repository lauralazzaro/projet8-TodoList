### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- PHP (>=8.2)
- Composer
- Node.js (20.15.0 LTS)
- Npm (10.7.0)
- SQLite 
- Symfony 7.1 (latest stable version)

### Symfony Version Choice

For this project, I have chosen to use the most recent stable version of Symfony instead of the Long-Term Support (LTS) version for the following reasons:

1. **Easier To Maintain Up To Date**: Using the latest version of Symfony makes it simpler to keep the project updated with minor releases, reducing the risk of large, time-consuming upgrades.
2. **Performance Improvements**: The latest version includes optimizations that improve the performance.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Newer versions have additional security features that are not always available in the LTS version.
4. **Access to Latest Features**: If needed, it makes easier to access cutting-edge features unavailable in the LTS release.

### Database Choice

For this project, I have chosen to use SQLite for the following reasons:

1. **Ease of Installation**: SQLite does not require a separate server setup, which simplifies the installation process and have the application up and running quickly.
2. **Testing and Demonstration**: SQLite is ideal for testing and demonstration purposes because it is lightweight and easy to configure.
3. **Simplicity**: SQLite is a single-file database, making it easy to manage and distribute with the application.

For production environments, it is recommended to use a more robust database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL. 

### Installation

- **Clone the repository:**

  Choose the URL of preference from the code page of the repository.

  MAILER_DSN=smtp://your-email:your-password@smpt-server
  MAILER_TO=[use-your-email-to-intercept-signup-mail]
  MAILER_FROM=[use-your-email]
  ```
- **Create `.env.test` and set up the file with these variables:**

  ```bash

  DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/test.db
  MAILER_DSN=smtp://your-email:your-password@smpt-server
  MAILER_TO=[use-your-email-to-intercept-signup-mail]
